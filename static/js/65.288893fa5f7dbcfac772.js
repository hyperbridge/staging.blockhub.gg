It's because people enjoying the game aren't there, THEY'RE PLAYING THE GAME. That's why we need to use COMPARISON metrics to determine the state of your feedback to other games. This, along with the reputations system, will greatly improve the feedback loop to your internal testers. Ultimately you do decide, but we want to make it super easy to understand your community. For the growth of your game, both the developer and the community need to work together, it's a symbiotic relationship.
